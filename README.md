AMT_project1
=============

Heig-VD AMT_project1 : REST-API

The main project goal is to offer a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform to organizations.

Our API is designed for organizations that use sensors to capture data.
The organization using our API can manage itself (name, person of contact, ...) but also the resources that are disponible in the organization like the users and the sensors.
Organization sensors will generate observations that are also managed via the API.
We have decided to generate some kinde of facts (daily facts : to find out statiscit of the daily work of a specific sensor, or counter fact : that are facts following the number of observation provided by a sensor) based on observations.
